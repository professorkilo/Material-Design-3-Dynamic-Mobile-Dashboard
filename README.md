# Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard

A modern Home Assistant dashboard built on Material Design 3 (MD3) principles. It features a dynamic, transparent, and adaptive card layout with a sleek, clean UI for an elegant smart home experience. This is a complete dashboard that brings together lights, switches, temperature and humidity, rainfall, wind, weather forecasts, alarms, Hue scenes, cameras, heat pumps, door/window sensors, and more—all in one cohesive design.

_v3.1.2_ [full_yaml](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/full_yaml) was updated to match the new card spec from Lovelace Material Component, as the previous version has been deprecated.

For the images, you can get them from [here](https://github.com/Hypfer/hass-scene_presets/blob/master/custom_components/scene_presets/assets/Readme.md).
