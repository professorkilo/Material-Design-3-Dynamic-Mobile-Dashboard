A modern Home Assistant dashboard built on Material Design 3 (MD3) principles, featuring dynamic colors, transparent and adaptive card layouts, and a sleek, clean UI for an elegant smart home experience. 

This comprehensive dashboard unifies control and monitoring for **lights, switches, temperature and humidity sensors, rainfall, wind, UV index, radar, weather forecasts, alarms, Hue scenes, cameras, heat pumps, door and window sensors, and irrigation control** - all presented in one cohesive, visually refined interface designed for both functionality and aesthetic harmony.

This update aligns the mobile experience with the previously shared tablet layout, using the same updated structures and design patterns.

The [v4.0.0](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/releases/tag/v4.0.0) major update introduces a significantly more modular system across most cards, making customization much easier than before. The new streamline card allows you to map entities directly through the UI, reducing setup time and improving overall flexibility. You can use the [streamline_templates](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/tree/main/assets) as a solid starting point to build and tailor your dashboard to your specific requirements.

# 🖼️ Dashboard Walkthrough

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fda42a3-5930-4a14-b8f3-e993e7565057" />

**Overview Page**


The Overview page gives you a quick view and control of what matters most. At the top, it displays the [current date and time, your alarm status, and a notification bell](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/greeting%2C%20alarmo%2C%20and%20notification%20bell) that highlights important alerts.

Next, there is a [personalized greeting](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/personalized%20greeting%20example) with current weather temperature and condition, including wind speed, high and low temp.
Below it, there are [three tabs: Home, Environment, and Active](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/overview%20page%20tab).

_Home Tab_
The Home tab features cards designed for quick interaction. The first card shows indoor and outdoor temperatures with built-in climate controls in a clean, unified layout. Below this is a swipeable section where you can toggle room occupancy for climate control, room presence for lighting, and security cameras for quick on/off. These controls are used daily to interact with the backend automations. Underneath, there’s a “Now Playing” music card and a [floating navigation bar](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/tree/main/assets). The calendar is hidden behind this bar and can be accessed by swiping on the screen.

_Environment Tab_
The Environment tab provides a quick overview of temperature and humidity. Sensor statuses are represented with dynamic colors to make changes and alerts easy to spot.

_Active Tab_
The Active tab filters and displays entities that are currently on or active. For example, it can show lights left on, open doors, and other active devices such as climate systems, curtains, and windows.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6edb3eb-9cd2-4d3f-b960-187ce062d051" />

**Pop Up Cards**

Pop-up cards are hidden within the Overview page and appear when you tap specific buttons or cards.

The [Now Playing music card](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/now%20playing%20pop%20up%20card) can be accessed by tapping the floating music control mentioned earlier.
The [Notifications card](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/notification%20center%20example) displays important items defined in your templates.yaml, such as chore management, active timers, live camera feeds when a door is opened, and sprinkler status.
The [Alarmo card](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/alarmo%20card%20example) is opened by tapping the alarm icon in the top-right corner, allowing you to quickly arm or disarm the alarm system.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Untitled design" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6820d3e-c3a5-4aec-b4a4-0833525213d5" />

**Room Card Overview**

[The Room Card Overview](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/Room%20Card%20example) gives you a quick snapshot of each room’s temperature and humidity, with the card color dynamically reflecting the current room status. Each card includes up to four customizable quick-action buttons for controls such as climate, lights, windows, doors, curtains, and fans. Tapping the room name takes you directly to that room’s dedicated page.

Version 4 introduces room toggle controls, allowing you to quickly switch between rooms without needing to swipe through long lists. This significantly improves usability in larger homes with 10+ rooms, where excessive scrolling previously became cumbersome. This will require [input_boolean](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/tree/main/assets), [automation](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/room%20toggle%20automation), and [script](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/room%20toggle%20script).

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="3(1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b13b44-7e78-4781-91d7-a432b0f9eb08" />

**Lighting Control**

I love Philips Hue, but I decided not to use the bridge. Instead, I connected the lights directly to Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M) and rely on [Hass Scene Preset](https://github.com/Hypfer/hass-scene_presets) to make the effects work without the bridge.
To activate a scene, I simply click the [image representing the effect](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/hue%20scene%20image%20example) and select a room. This setup is made possible using a combination of powerful HACS components, automations, scripts, input booleans, input_number, and input texts. Check this [folder](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/tree/main/hue%20asset) to set it up.

**Irrigation**

The irrigation page shows the current weather restriction level, along with [tabs for different irrigation zones](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/irrigation%20page). It includes details such as each zone’s water valve status, the last run time, and direct controls for each valve - all presented with a clear, visually rich graph.

Below that, the system displays soil moisture levels, color-coded according to dryness, as well as the soil temperature for each zone.

Additionally, automations and scripts are used to control the valves, including phone notifications when the sprinklers turn on or off.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a4db88f-c30b-45e5-a715-410843723a14" />


**Individual Room Page**

The individual room page starts with a [header](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/individual%20room%20page%20description) displaying the room’s temperature, occupancy status, and the last time it was active.
Below that are quick buttons for toggling features such as room presence automation or activating Movie Mode (as shown in this example).

Further down, there are [three tabs](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/individual%20room%20page%20tabs):

- Room Tab: Contains light entities and a popup card for additional lights, as well as other elements like covers, media, switch, or anything else relevant to the room.

- Climate Tab: Displays climate controls for the room and shows humidity levels. In this example, the humidity is too high, so the indicator color appears red.

- Active Tab: This tab only appears when something in the room is active - such as an open door or window.


<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40b9ae1f-4990-46e9-93e5-b82731758b5b" />

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01556bdc-aafb-4d62-8807-3a8df9948506" />


**Weather Panel**

The [comprehensive weather panel](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/weather%20panel) is a popup card accessible by clicking any of the weather forecast buttons at the top of the Overview page (as mentioned earlier).
Some tabs may be hidden when there are no active events - for example, if there are no earthquakes or volcanic activities at the moment.

This panel includes the following components:

- Earthquake
- Volcano
- Warning
- Weather Forecast
- Rainfall
- UV
- Wind
- Radar
 -Lunar

Each section highlights the next significant forecasted event.
For example, the Wind section displays when the strongest forecasted wind is expected and its intensity, while the chart below shows the current wind speed in real time.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccc869c1-5a6b-4e07-8a31-e957edfb12a0" />

**Camera + Timeline**

The [Cameras](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/camera%20tabs%20example) + [Timeline page](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/camera%20timeline) displays live camera feeds from each area, showing the last detected activity along with controls for nearby lights for quick actions.
The timeline view is powered by an [LLM Vision](https://llmvision.org/), which automatically generates short descriptions for detected events - displaying up to 10 events at a time.

**Server Overview**

The Server Overview provides [system performance data and graphs](https://github.com/ElementZoom/Material-Design-3-Dynamic-Mobile-Dashboard/blob/main/assets/server%20visuals), including Home Assistant updates, CPU usage, memory consumption, network speed, and more - giving a complete snapshot of your server’s health and activity.
